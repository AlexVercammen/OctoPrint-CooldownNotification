# OctoPrint-CooldownNotification

This plugin is designed to execute gcode commands when the print bed cools to a certain temperature.

The intended usage is to utilize the M300 gcode to alert that the bed has cooled and it's safe to remove prints printed in PETG.

## Setup

or manually using this URL:
